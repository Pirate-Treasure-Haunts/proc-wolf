proc-wolf
Advanced Process Monitor and Security Tool for Windows
Overview
proc-wolf is a powerful security tool designed to detect and handle suspicious processes using a multi-layered verification approach. Unlike simple process killers, proc-wolf uses a sophisticated trust system to identify genuine threats while avoiding false positives.
Key Features

Multi-layer Trust Verification: Combines hardcoded system-critical list, digital signature verification, location checks, and behavioral analysis
Intelligent Threat Assessment: Evaluates processes based on multiple factors to determine threat level
Escalating Response System: Takes appropriate action from monitoring to complete prevention based on threat severity
Historical Analysis: Maintains a database of previously seen processes and their behavior
Quarantine Capabilities: Can isolate suspicious executables for later examination

How It Works
proc-wolf uses a comprehensive approach to differentiate between legitimate and suspicious processes:

Safe List Approach: System-critical Windows processes and standard utilities are protected
Digital Signature Verification: Checks if executables are signed by trusted publishers
Location Analysis: Examines where processes are running from (suspicious vs. standard locations)
Behavioral Analysis: Monitors CPU/memory usage, file access, network connections, etc.
Pattern Recognition: Identifies suspicious naming patterns commonly used by malware

When a suspicious process is detected, proc-wolf assigns a threat level (0-4) and takes appropriate action:

Level 0 (TRUSTED): Monitor only
Level 1 (LOW): Issue warnings
Level 2 (MEDIUM): Attempt soft kill if persistence is detected
Level 3 (HIGH): Force kill
Level 4 (CRITICAL): Prevent resurrection by disabling services and quarantining executables

Requirements

Windows 7/8/10/11
Python 3.6+
Administrator privileges (recommended for full functionality)

Installation

python proc-wolf.py


Advanced Usage
Running as a Service
For continuous protection, you can set up proc-wolf to run as a Windows service.
Customization
You can customize threat detection by modifying the following lists in the source code:

SYSTEM_CRITICAL: Critical system processes that should never be terminated
TRUSTED_PUBLISHERS: Trusted digital signature publishers
SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS: Regex patterns that match suspicious process names

Safety Features
proc-wolf includes several safeguards to prevent damaging your system:

Hardcoded protection for essential Windows components
Multiple verification layers to minimize false positives
Escalating response system that starts with monitoring before taking action
