A sophisticated Windows process monitoring and threat detection system that guards your system against malicious processes while respecting legitimate software.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Continuously monitors all running processes
- **Multi-layered Threat Detection**: Uses behavioral analysis, signature verification, and heuristic patterns
- **Conservative Action System**: Graduated response system (Monitor ‚Üí Warn ‚Üí Kill ‚Üí Quarantine ‚Üí Nuke)
- **Comprehensive Windows Recognition**: Whitelists 216+ legitimate Windows processes and services
- **Self-Protection**: Won't attack itself or critical system components
- **Automatic Quarantine**: Isolates suspicious executables safely

### Deployment Options
- **Windows Service**: Runs silently in the background with automatic startup
- **System Tray Application**: User-friendly interface with notifications
- **Command Line Interface**: Direct control for power users
- **Debug Mode**: For testing and troubleshooting

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Administrator privileges
- Python 3.8+ (for building from source)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Pre-built Release (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/proc-wolf/releases)
2. Extract to your preferred location
3. Right-click `install.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
4. The service will start automatically

#### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proc-wolf.git
cd proc-wolf

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build executables
python build_exe.py

# Install the service
cd dist
install.bat
```

## Usage

### Service Control
Use `service_control.bat` for easy management:
```
1. STATUS  - Check service status
2. START   - Start the service
3. STOP    - Stop the service gracefully
4. RESTART - Restart the service
5. KILL    - Force kill all instances
6. CLEAN   - Complete removal
7. DEBUG   - Run in debug mode
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# List all processes with threat assessment
ProcWolfCLI.exe list --assess

# Assess a specific process
ProcWolfCLI.exe assess --name suspicious.exe

# Kill a dangerous process
ProcWolfCLI.exe kill --name malware.exe

# Complete removal of a process
ProcWolfCLI.exe nuke --name virus.exe

# View process history
ProcWolfCLI.exe history

# Real-time monitoring
ProcWolfCLI.exe monitor
```

### System Tray Monitor
Run `ProcWolf.exe` for a user-friendly system tray interface with:
- Real-time notifications
- Quick access to controls
- Visual status indicators

## Security Model

### Threat Levels
- **TRUSTED (0)**: Known legitimate processes
- **LOW (1)**: Minor suspicion indicators
- **MEDIUM (2)**: Multiple suspicious characteristics
- **HIGH (3)**: Strong malware indicators
- **CRITICAL (4)**: Confirmed malicious behavior

### Action Thresholds
- **MONITOR**: Observe only (LOW threat)
- **WARN**: Alert user (MEDIUM threat, 10+ warnings)
- **KILL**: Terminate process (MEDIUM threat, 20+ warnings)
- **QUARANTINE**: Isolate executable (HIGH threat, 15+ warnings)
- **NUKE**: Complete removal with resurrection prevention (CRITICAL threat, confirmed)

## Configuration

### Database Location
`C:\ProgramData\proc-wolf\proc-wolf.db`

### Log Files
- Service logs: `C:\ProgramData\proc-wolf\proc-wolf-service.log`
- Background logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\proc-wolf\proc-wolf-background.log`
- CLI logs: `proc-wolf-cli.log` (executable directory)

### Quarantine Directory
`C:\ProgramData\proc-wolf\quarantine\`
